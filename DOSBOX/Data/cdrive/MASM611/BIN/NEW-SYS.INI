; If your SYSTEM.INI file already contains DEVICE= statements with
; the same filenames, replace the old DEVICE= statements with the ones
; shown here.  Windows 3.x will not run if the SYSTEM.INI file contains
; more than one DEVICE= statements for a single driver.
;
; If your SYSTEM.INI file contains a DEVICE= statement for CV1.386,
; a driver which is no longer necessary, Windows 3.x will not run.
; Remove the DEVICE=CV1.386 statement to solve this problem.
