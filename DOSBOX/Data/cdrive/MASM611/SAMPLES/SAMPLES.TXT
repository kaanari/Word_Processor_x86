                     Notes on MASM 6.11 Sample Programs
                     (c) Copyright Microsoft Corp. 1993


Note:      If you installed the samples during MASM 6.11 setup, you will 
           have samples for MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, and Microsoft 
           Windows NT on your system. However, you need to install MASM 
           6.11 for the appropriate operating system(s) in order to run 
           each sample.

==========================================================================

Directory: SAMPLES\DEMOS

Contents:  This directory includes three separate projects: FileDemo, 
           MathDemo, and MiscDemo.  Each demonstrates the use of assembly
           language to perform simple utility functions using MS-DOS and 
           BIOS calls.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Directory: SAMPLES\DOSDEV

Contents:  This sample demonstrates construction of an MS-DOS device driver. 
           The driver can be used to exchange string data between multiple 
           MS-DOS applications, somewhat like the Windows GlobalAtom() API. 
           Includes the code for the device driver, an assembly-language
           test program, and a C-language test program.

Tools:     Microsoft C is required to build the C test program.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Directory: SAMPLES\MIXED

Contents:  Demonstrates mixed-language programming with MASM and FORTRAN,
           BASIC, and C.

Tools:     A FORTRAN, BASIC, or C compiler is required to build the
           modules written in those languages.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Directory: SAMPLES\PWBTUTOR

Contents:  Demonstrates the Programmer's Workbench environment.  This
           sample is intended to be used with the PWB tutorial in the
           MASM Environment and Tools book.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Directory: SAMPLES\SHOW

Contents:  A speedy text file browser, written entirely in assembly
           language.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Directory: SAMPLES\TSR

Contents:  Demonstrates how to write a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) 
           utility in assembly or in mixed C and assembly language.  
           Includes a toolkit of TSR functions that can be used to write 
           your own TSR's.

Tools:     Requires Microsoft C to build the mixed-language example.

Notes:     When assembled with the /Zi switch, several modules will cause
           a warning related to line number information in a segment of
           class other than 'CODE'.  This is because the code in question
           is discarded after you install the TSR, and you cannot debug it
           using CodeView.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Directory: SAMPLES\WINCLOCK

Contents:  A digital alarm clock for Microsoft Windows.  The left mouse
           button moves or resizes the clock; the right button brings up
           a menu.

Tools:     Requires the Microsoft Windows SDK or Visual C++.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Directory: SAMPLES\WINDLL

Contents:  Demonstrates writing a DLL for Microsoft Windows in assembly
           language.  Includes a Windows test program that calls the DLL; 
           the DLL can also be called from applications such as Microsoft
           Visual BASIC. This sample also demonstrates the use of H2INC,
           which converts the C header file SYSDATA.H to MASM include file
           SYSDATA.INC.

Tools:     Requires the Microsoft Windows SDK or Visual C++ to build the 
           test program.

Note:      When SYSINFO.DLL is built using Link 5.5 or later, it will
           generate warning L4059. This warning can be ignored. It only
           occurs in later versions of the linker and does not occur with 
           Link 5.31 (shipped with MASM 6.11). The warning only applies 
           to MS-DOS-overlaid programs; it is safe to ignore the warning in 
           this case. The warning should never occur with a Windows 
           application.
