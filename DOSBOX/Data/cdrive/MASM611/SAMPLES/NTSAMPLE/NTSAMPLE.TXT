              Notes on MASM 6.11 for Windows NT Sample Programs 
                     (c) Copyright Microsoft Corp. 1993

Notes:     - If you installed the samples during MASM 6.11 setup, you will 
             have samples for MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, and Microsoft 
             Windows NT on your system. However, you need to install MASM 
             6.11 for the appropriate operating system(s) in order to run 
             each sample.

           - All of the following examples require MASM 6.11 in order to 
             assemble. Linking the resulting .obj files to create 
             executable files requires a 32-bit linker. 

           - The make files in the following samples call a 32-bit linker 
             named LINK.EXE. The name of the linker included in the Windows 
             NT software development kit is LINK32.EXE. If your only 32-bit
             linker is LINK32.EXE, an error will occur because no linker can 
             be found or because a 16-bit linker is on the path.

           - The example makefiles use names and switches that are specific 
             to Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit edition. If you are using 
             the Windows NT Software Development Kit (SKD) to build the 
             samples, you must add "TOOLS=SDK" to the NMAKE command line; 
             for example:
               
             nmake TOOLS=SDK /a /f casmdll.mak

Directory: NTSAMPLE\NTDLL

Contents:  This sample demonstrates how to create a mixed-language (MASM
           and Microsoft C) dynamic-link library for Windows NT.

Note:      Requires Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit edition, or the Windows NT 
           SDK to build the sample.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Directory: NTSAMPLE\HELLO

Contents:  The sample is a "Hello, world" application developed in assembly 
           language to use the 32-bit flat memory model of Windows NT.

           The supplied sample code and makefile perform the following 
           three steps, assembling a 32-bit flat-memory-model application 
           for the Windows NT environment. 

           1. Places the .386 or .486 directive in the code prior to the 
              .MODEL flat, stdcall directive to ensure that the code and 
              data segments are correctly initialized for a 32-bit flat- 
              memory-model application.

           2. Assembles the source code using the following command:

                ML /c /coff hello.asm

           3. Uses the LINK utility provided with the Windows NT SDK or 
              Visual C++ for NT to link the object modules. 

Note:     In the MASM code, do not use the INCLUDELIB directive and do not 
          place the starting label after the END directive. The LINK utility 
          provided with the Windows NT SDK ignores the default library names 
          in object files and requires the -entry switch on the linker 
          command line to specify the starting address.

Directory: SAMPLES\NTSAMPLE\SZSEARCH

Contents:  This sample demonstrates how to program for Windows NT. The 
           sample includes a routine that searches for a substring 
           within a buffer, using a variation of the Boyer-Moore method.

Note:      Requires Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit edition, or the Windows NT 
           SDK to build the sample.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Directory: NTSAMPLE\THREADS

Contents:  In this sample, two threads are created: one from a C procedure, 
           the other from an assembly-language procedure. The first draws a 
           green box, the second a red box. Both boxes are moved about the 
           screen as their individual threads calculate a new position and 
           redraw the box.

Note:      Requires Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit edition, or the Windows NT 
           SDK to build the sample.
